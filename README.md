# keylogger
This is a terminal-based keylogger designed for Kali Linux, capable of running in the background as a daemon while logging keystrokes with timestamps and active window titles. It also features auto-sending logs via email or Telegram and keystroke analysis to detect word patterns and suspicious text.
